# A gentle introduction to bayesian non-parametrics.

This introduction is written for python-loving non-statisticians. I aim to provide some intuition about what differentiates bayesian statistics from regular statistics, and similarly, what differentiates parametric models from non-parametric ones. A deployed notebook can be found [here](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/vmasrani-bayes--metric-tutorial-ome9is7v/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb).
